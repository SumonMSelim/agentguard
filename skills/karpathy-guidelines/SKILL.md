# Karpathy Guidelines

Reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Derived from [Andrej Karpathy's observations](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2015883857489522876).

**Tradeoff:** Biases toward caution over speed. Use judgment on trivial tasks.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**State assumptions. Surface confusion. Show tradeoffs.**

- State assumptions explicitly. Uncertain → ask.
- Multiple interpretations → present them, don't pick silently.
- Simpler approach exists → say so. Push back when warranted.
- Unclear → stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- 200 lines that could be 50 → rewrite it.

Ask: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- Unrelated dead code → mention it, don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

Test: every changed line must trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria → loop independently.
Weak criteria ("make it work") → constant clarification.
